# New-Build-Deployment-Script
Powershell script I wrote to automate the configuration of newly imaged laptops/desktops at my current company. 

One script handles the installation of the standard packages required by the department and the other handles basic setup of the new user profile including updating group policy, mapping network printers, mounting shared drive folders and adding requested shortcuts to the desktop.

Before writing this script, performing the manual steps for these processes would have taken over an hour. Now all tasks can be done in under 5 minutes :)

Some contents of the file were edited to protect proprietary information.
